# Comparison Operators

---

## Equality (==) and Inequality (!=)

Checks if two `Sq` instances `lhs` and `rhs` are equal or not, considering their scaled values.

**Constraints:**

- Both `Sq` instances must have the same resolution (`f`). If the resolutions are different, the operation will automatically convert them to the larger resolution before comparison.
- Both `Sq` instances must have the same signedness. If they have different signedness, the left-hand side (lhs) type must have a larger size compared to the right-hand side (rhs) type.

**Output:**

| `bool` | |
|-|-|
| *value* | *true* if scaled values are equal, otherwise *false* |

**Example:**

```cpp
i32sq7<-100., 200.> sq1 = 150.0_i32sq7;
u16sq8<0., 100.> sq2 = 50.0_u16sq8;
bool isEqual = (sq1 == sq2);  // false
bool isNotEqual = (sq1 != sq2);  // true

u16sq7<0., 150.> sq3 = 150.0_u16sq7;
bool isEqual2 = (sq1 == sq3);  // true
```

## Ordering (Spaceship Operator <=>)

Performs a three-way comparison of two `Sq` instances `lhs` and `rhs`, producing a result that indicates whether the first is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.

**Constraints:**

- Both `Sq` instances must have the same resolution (`f`). If the resolutions are different, the operation will automatically convert them to the larger resolution before comparison.
- Both `Sq` instances must have the same signedness. If they have different signedness, the left-hand side (lhs) type must have a larger size compared to the right-hand side (rhs) type.

**Output:**

| `strong::ordering` | |
|-|-|
| *value* | depending on the values one of: *less*, *equal*, *greater* |

**Example:**

```cpp
i32sq7<-100., 200.> sq1 = 150.0_i32sq7;
u16sq7<0., 100.> sq2 = 50.0_u16sq7;
u16sq7<0., 150.> sq3 = 150.0_u16sq7;
i16sq7<-200., 100.> sq4 = -50.0_i16sq7;

auto cmpResult1 = (sq1 <=> sq2);  // std::strong_ordering::greater
auto cmpResult2 = (sq1 <=> sq3);  // std::strong_ordering::equal
auto cmpResult3 = (sq4 <=> sq1);  // std::strong_ordering::less
```

These operators allow for intuitive and straightforward comparison of `Sq` instances, ensuring that their underlying scaled values are considered while respecting the resolution and type constraints.

## Ordering (<, >, <=, >=)

Compares two `Sq` instances `lhs` and `rhs`, determining if one is less than, greater than, less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to the other based on their scaled values.

**Note:** These operators are generated by the compiler from the spaceship operator implementation.

**Constraints:**

- Both `Sq` instances must have the same resolution (`f`). If the resolutions are different, the operation will automatically convert them to the larger resolution before comparison.
- Both `Sq` instances must have the same signedness. If they have different signedness, the left-hand side (lhs) type must have a larger size compared to the right-hand side (rhs) type.

**Output:**

| `bool` | |
|-|-|
| *value* | *true* or *false* based on the comparison |

**Example:**

```cpp
i32sq10<-100., 200.> sq1 = 150.0_i32sq10;
u16sq7<0., 100.> sq2 = 50.0_u16sq7;
u16sq7<0., 150.> sq3 = 150.0_u16sq7;
i16sq7<-200., 100.> sq4 = -50.0_i16sq7;

bool isLessThan = (sq1 < sq2);  // false
bool isGreaterThan = (sq1 > sq2);  // true
bool isLessThanOrEqual = (sq1 <= sq3);  // true
bool isGreaterThanOrEqual = (sq4 >= sq1);  // false

// usage in conditional statements
if (sq1 < sq2) {
    // sq1 is less than sq2
}
else if (sq1 > sq2) {
    // sq1 is greater than sq2
}
else if (sq1 <= sq2) {
    // sq1 is less than or equal to sq2
}
else if (sq1 >= sq2) {
    // sq1 is greater than or equal to sq2
}
else {}
```
